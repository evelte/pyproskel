## Project structure

The initial project structure is created like the following:

project_name
	project_name
		__init__.py
	setup.py
	readme.md

The top level directory is the root of the project, as well as the root of the VCS (git in this case).
The subdirectory *project_name* is the actual python module, with its corresponding __init__ file.


*See below a screenshot of the running script*
